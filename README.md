# SFML_Random

This is a collection of some project in one. Here I played around with chained lists, arrays, a snake game with SFML and a TicTacToe game with a stupid AI :)

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites and basic information

- This application is tested in windows 10/11
- This repo does not provide an executable -> you have to compile your own (I used Visual Studio)
- I don't guarantee that every corner case has been taken into account. The project is part of my learning process for C++ and SFML
- All dependencies are included in this repo, so it is almost plug and play :)
